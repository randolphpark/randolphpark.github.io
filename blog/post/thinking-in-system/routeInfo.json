It consists of three kinds of things: elements, interconnections and a function or purpose.\n\n> You think that because you understand \"one\" that you must, therefore, understand \"two\" because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also understand \"and\".\n\n- Information about the existence of a problem may be necessary but not sufficient to trigger action - information about resources, incentives and consequences are necessary too.\n- To ask whether elements, interconnections, or purpose are most important in a system is to ask an unsystematic question. All are essential. But the least obvious part of the system, its functions or purpose, is often the most crucial determinant of the system's behaviour. Interconnections are also critically important. Changing relationships usually change system behaviour. The elements, the parts of systems we are most likely to notice, are often least important in defining the unique characteristics of the system0unless changing an element also result in changing relationship or purpose.\n\n--\n","data":{"layout":"blog","title":"Thinking in system","date":"2019-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51frZKhRiIL._SX330_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg","rating":"5","slug":"thinking-in-system"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""}},"path":"blog/post/thinking-in-system"}
