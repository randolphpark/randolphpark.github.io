What is leadership, anyway?\n\n> Leadership is the process of creating an environment in which people become empowered.\n\n## 2. Models of leadership style\n\n- *M*: motivation - the trophies or trouble, the push or pull that moves the people involved.\n- *O*: organisation - the existing structure that enables the ideas to be worked through into practice.\n- *I*: ideas or innovation - the seeds, the image of what will become.\n\nWhat Technical Leaders Do\n\n- understanding the problem\n- managing the flow of ideas\n- maintaining quality\n\n## 3. A problem-solving style\n\n### Understanding the problem\n\n- Read the specifications very carefully.\n- Encourage teammates to read the specifications very carefully.\n- Resolve arguments by referring back to the original problem.\n- Seek clarifications and additional information about the specifications from the customer.\n- Refer back to the specifications after work has proceeded for a while, when the implications of the requirements can be better understood.\n\n### Managing the flow of ideas\n\n- Contribute a clever idea to the team.\n- Encourage copying of useful ideas.\n- Elaborate on an idea that a teammate contributed.\n- Drop one's own idea in favour of an idea the team wants to develop.\n- Resist time pressure, and take the time to listen when other people explain their idea.\n- Test ideas contributed by other people.\n- Withhold quick criticism of teammates' ideas, in order to keep the ideas flowing.\n- When you must criticize an idea, make clear that you are criticizing the idea, not the person who offered the idea.\n- Test your own ideas before offering them.\n- When time and labour are running short, stop working on new ideas and just pitch in.\n- Encourage the team to drop ideas that had succeeded earlier, but cannot be extended to the new situation.\n- Revive a dropped idea later, when it has value for another part of the problem.\n\n\n### Maintaining quality\n\n- Measure quality as the project proceeds.\n- Design tools and processes to measure quality as you build a solution.\n- Measure the speed of implementation, compare it to the schedule, and be prepared to change the solution procedure.\n- Step back from the project to refresh your perspective and to assess its viability.\n- Check ideas with the customer before implementing them.\n- Restore morale when an idea collapses\n\n\n## 3. How Leaders Develop\n \n![alt text](https://vegdave.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/learning_curve.jpg?w=600&h=444 \"Leadership growth chart\")\n\n\n- Practice makes perfect\n- The great leap forward\n- Falling into the ravine\n- Growth in the real world (like image above)\n- How growth feels\n- The metacycle\n\n## 4. But I can't because...\n\n### I'm not a leader\n\nThe best designed working groups are those in which leadership comes from everybody, not merely the appointed leaders. Therefore, you need not wait - you should not wait - for an appointment.\n\n### I'm not the leader type\n\nConsider leadership by innovation, by adding a new technique to the group's ways of getting things done. Leadership by innovation fit who lack the charisma and organizational skills. But do remember it is the combination of MOI.\n\n### I'll lose my technical skills\n\nYes, it will happen. And consider it regarding MOI. This means an evolution toward a balance among the three factors.\n\n### I'm in grave danger of growing\n\nIt's not bad to postpone change until circumstances force it upon you.\n\n### I don't want that much power\n\nTechnical leaders possess great power in our society, but they are neither demons nor gods. They are ordinary people who happen to possess an effective approach to problem-solving, an approach based on leadership through innovation. Even without any technical background, other ordinary people can empower themselves and others by mastering some elements of this approach. \n\n\n---","data":{"layout":"blog","title":"[BOOK] Becoming A Technical Leader","date":"2019-01-30T00:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510T3Y9382L._SX327_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg","rating":"5","slug":"book-becoming-a-technical-leader"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"\n---\n\n## Having a folder reference to different branch so that you can easy access\n\n### Usecase: Github Page deployment\n\n* Constrain: Deployment has to be in master branch\n\n* Solution:\n\n  * `$ echo \"dist/\" >> .gitignore`\n  * `$ git worktree add dist master`\n  * Set default branch to `development`\n  * When you develop in `development` branch\n    * Build into `dist`\n    * Deploy inside `dist` to `master` branch\n\nReference [Lin](khttps://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490#gistcomment-2375522)\n\n---","data":{"layout":"blog","title":"[TIL] Git","date":"2019-01-29T00:00:00.000Z","thumbnail":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*4W4fdnO680ysRhFc9ppc8w.jpeg","rating":"5","slug":"til-git"},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":""},{"content":"\n---\n## Tips\n\n1. don't completely rewirte software in RUST\n  - Split out slice and use RUST \n  - Proxy out into RUST\n2. show up with code\n3. dont' sell\n4. sell sell sell - drop small cool stuff\n5. the hard part of programming isn't programming - it's about ecosystem\n6. the hard part of programming is programming\n7. be prepared for things to stay the same\n  - intorduce change slowly and mesaure impact as you go\n8. have a problem to solve\n9. learning curves are a blessing in disguise\n\n\nVideo Reference \n_Ashley Williams - How I Convinced the World's Largest Package Manager to Use Rust, and So Can You!
