## 1. What is leadership, anyway?

> Leadership is the process of creating an environment in which people become empowered.

## 2. Models of leadership style

- *M*: motivation - the trophies or trouble, the push or pull that moves the people involved.
- *O*: organisation - the existing structure that enables the ideas to be worked through into practice.
- *I*: ideas or innovation - the seeds, the image of what will become.

What Technical Leaders Do

- understanding the problem
- managing the flow of ideas
- maintaining quality

## 3. A problem-solving style

### Understanding the problem

- Read the specifications very carefully.
- Encourage teammates to read the specifications very carefully.
- Resolve arguments by referring back to the original problem.
- Seek clarifications and additional information about the specifications from the customer.
- Refer back to the specifications after work has proceeded for a while, when the implications of the requirements can be better understood.

### Managing the flow of ideas

- Contribute a clever idea to the team.
- Encourage copying of useful ideas.
- Elaborate on an idea that a teammate contributed.
- Drop one's own idea in favour of an idea the team wants to develop.
- Resist time pressure, and take the time to listen when other people explain their idea.
- Test ideas contributed by other people.
- Withhold quick criticism of teammates' ideas, in order to keep the ideas flowing.
- When you must criticize an idea, make clear that you are criticizing the idea, not the person who offered the idea.
- Test your own ideas before offering them.
- When time and labour are running short, stop working on new ideas and just pitch in.
- Encourage the team to drop ideas that had succeeded earlier, but cannot be extended to the new situation.
- Revive a dropped idea later, when it has value for another part of the problem.


### Maintaining quality

- Measure quality as the project proceeds.
- Design tools and processes to measure quality as you build a solution.
- Measure the speed of implementation, compare it to the schedule, and be prepared to change the solution procedure.
- Step back from the project to refresh your perspective and to assess its viability.
- Check ideas with the customer before implementing them.
- Restore morale when an idea collapses
