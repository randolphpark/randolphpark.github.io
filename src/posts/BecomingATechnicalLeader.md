## 1. What is leadership, anyway?

> Leadership is the process of creating an environment in which people become empowered.

## 2. Models of leadership style

- *M*: motivation - the trophies or trouble, the push or pull that moves the people involved.
- *O*: organisation - the existing structure that enables the ideas to be worked through into practice.
- *I*: ideas or innovation - the seeds, the image of what will become.

What Technical Leaders Do

- understanding the problem
- managing the flow of ideas
- maintaining quality

## 3. A problem-solving style

### Understanding the problem

- Read the specifications very carefully.
- Encourage teammates to read the specifications very carefully.
- Resolve arguments by referring back to the original problem.
- Seek clarifications and additional information about the specifications from the customer.
- Refer back to the specifications after work has proceeded for a while, when the implications of the requirements can be better understood.

### Managing the flow of ideas

- Contribute a clever idea to the team.
- Encourage copying of useful ideas.
- Elaborate on an idea that a teammate contributed.
- Drop one's own idea in favour of an idea the team wants to develop.
- Resist time pressure, and take the time to listen when other people explain their idea.
- Test ideas contributed by other people.
- Withhold quick criticism of teammates' ideas, in order to keep the ideas flowing.
- When you must criticize an idea, make clear that you are criticizing the idea, not the person who offered the idea.
- Test your own ideas before offering them.
- When time and labour are running short, stop working on new ideas and just pitch in.
- Encourage the team to drop ideas that had succeeded earlier, but cannot be extended to the new situation.
- Revive a dropped idea later, when it has value for another part of the problem.


### Maintaining quality

- Measure quality as the project proceeds.
- Design tools and processes to measure quality as you build a solution.
- Measure the speed of implementation, compare it to the schedule, and be prepared to change the solution procedure.
- Step back from the project to refresh your perspective and to assess its viability.
- Check ideas with the customer before implementing them.
- Restore morale when an idea collapses


## 4. How Leaders Develop
 
![alt text](https://vegdave.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/learning_curve.jpg?w=600&h=444 "Leadership growth chart")


- Practice makes perfect
- The great leap forward
- Falling into the ravine
- Growth in the real world (like image above)
- How growth feels
- The metacycle

## 5. But I can't because...

### I'm not a leader

The best designed working groups are those in which leadership comes from everybody, not merely the appointed leaders. Therefore, you need not wait - you should not wait - for an appointment.

### I'm not the leader type

Consider leadership by innovation, by adding a new technique to the group's ways of getting things done. Leadership by innovation fit who lack the charisma and organizational skills. But do remember it is the combination of MOI.

### I'll lose my technical skills

Yes, it will happen. And consider it regarding MOI. This means an evolution toward a balance among the three factors.

### I'm in grave danger of growing

It's not bad to postpone change until circumstances force it upon you.

### I don't want that much power

Technical leaders possess great power in our society, but they are neither demons nor gods. They are ordinary people who happen to possess an effective approach to problem-solving, an approach based on leadership through innovation. Even without any technical background, other ordinary people can empower themselves and others by mastering some elements of this approach. 

## 6. The three great obstacles to innovation

6.1 Self-blindness, concealing your own behaviour, so you have no chance of changing

6.2 No-Problem Syndrome, convincing you that you already know the answer to all problems

6.3 Belief in the central dogma of academic psychology, blinding you to alternative solutions, even ones you could generate without help from anyone else

## 7. A tool for developing self-awareness

7.1 Starting now and continuing for three months, spend five minutes each day writing in a personal journal.

7.2 Try to use physical paper.

7.3 It is important to find some method that ensures you write your 5 minutes each day.

7.4 Write everything down and find a format that fits you most. You can start with "Facts, feelings, findings" form.

7.5 Take time, review and find your pattern..

## 8. Developing idea power

**The problem-solving leader's central dogma**

Any real problem has one more solution, which nobody has found-yet

**Creative errors**

In fact, every mistake is a new idea, if seen by a mind prepared to use it.

**Stolen ideas**

You can take ideas from one person(called "plagiarising") or from many(called "research").

**Corrupted, stolen ideas**

Introduce an error in a stolen idea. It might transform the idea into the most creative and valuable one.

**Copulation**

Putting together two ideas to form a new one that's better than either of their parent.

**Why ideas seem wicked**

It's not an accident that error, theft, and copulation are the three great strategies for developing ideas. Their fundamental nature is shown by the role they play in the genetics of living systems.

By the time, you may have noticed the relationship between the three great idea generators and the three great obstacles to innovation. Lack of self-awareness means that we never notice our errors, so we cannot capture them and convert them to something wonderful. Belief in our own master intelligence means that we would never think to copy the work of someone else, so we cannot benefit from creative theft. And knowing that there is one and only one right solution to every problem makes combining ideas seems foolish, so copulation is ruled out.

## 9. The vision

The journey is always up and down.

* It's not the event that matters, but your reaction to the event.
* Everybody has failures, if only because their success leads them to fail.
* Every successful technical leader has a personal vision - It is something worth doing but also a unique part that only you can contribute. That's the key to achieving the vision. Joining a mass movement may keep you going as a person, but it won't keep you going as an innovator.
* People without vision don't have much influence on other people.
* Without a personal vision, no leadership skill or secret will do you any good. Without a vision, at the leading edge of technology, people and projects perish.
