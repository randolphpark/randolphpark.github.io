Personal thoughts:

When I jot down my canvas, I found the only resource I have is time, and the single value I can create is writing software. It rings a bell for me. It makes aware how vulnerable my business model is, how depends on the employer and how far I am from financial freedom.

There are two potential solutions I can think of.

Firstly, taking full advantage of the esiting resource and "re-sell" it. Every day I am learning a lot of things, but what if I can structure it and re-sell it in the form of blog or video.

Secondly, start to explore the new venue of the value stream. It was so powerful for me that, in the investment world,  you can make money by using the money. It is obvious that time is limited. Replying on time to create an income stream is not sustainable in the long term. Moreover, as time fly, it will become more and more valuable. Therefore, we need to use whatever we can to protect our time to be reserved with the most important thing.
