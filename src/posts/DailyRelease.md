What you repeat builds who you are. Having a good habit is shaping you in a long run. For software development, I think Daily Release would be the keystone habit that anchors a lot of positive changes.

* Encourage small size story
* Easy to test and isolate the problem
* Different mindset while we work on a story with “terrifying” responsibility and a better sense of achievement
* Continuous value delivery for business
* Data-informed feature delivery is possible.
* From Agile to “Lean story”
* Faster feedback loop
* Shaping company culture to focus on the most important deliverable task.


This is entire cultural shift and altering mindset to focus on each day and get most of the each day.

As a developer, this would be daily routine she/he might go through.

* Start new story you picked yesterday first thing at morning.
* Start development in branch.
* Add sufficient enough test, since it is small enough.
* Fishing up story 3 hours prior to the end of the day. S* Quash your commit , merge then ship to prod.
* * Quick check in prod, see if it is working ok. If it breaks anything, fix it within 1 hours. If not revert. It should be easy to fix, since it is small enough.
* If everything is great, then pick up the story you are going to work on tomorrow and see if it is feasible to deliver in one day.
* You might think the story is too big that it cannot delivered today. So you break down the story even further.
* Double check with PO about the trim down version of story. And confirm with business value.
* Head home and close the loop of work.

The simple principle of daily release is “All your work HAVE TO hit production by the end of the day. The rest? I believe you can figure it out”.

However, in the first day practicing Daily Release, I have been blocked. Because, today’s task is learning new techni* Que/tool. It was spike. This is “great” start and I felt I just discovered 2% of the problem. There would be still 98% to discover and solve.

It would be interesting journey to document all the problem I have enchanted and jot down the attempts and solution I tried.


All my questions.

* Q0. The value I can deliver TODAY vs the value we want to deliver but cannot finish TODAY.
* Q1. If the story is spike or learning, how can I do still practice Daily Release?
* Q2. What if we can get rid of iteration planning and only prioritise everyday and release everyday? What would be key difference between having plan for a week vs having plan only for TODAY?
* Q3. What kind of tooling would be necessary to enable daily release? Is there any platform to automate this process?
* Q4. What kind of book I can search for building fundamental understanding?
* Q5. It feels like Elixir being fault torrent programming language, it would have some uni* Que advantage to enable Daily Release. But what would be that?
* Q6. What would be the biggest obstacle to practice this method?
* Q7. What kind of project suite this? or every project should do it?
* Q8. How to design physical environment to enable Daily Release?
* Q9. What is the checklist for Daily Release?
* Q10. Would it be counter-productive due to the overhead infrastructure work?
* Q11. What kind of company need it? Startup? If it is Startup, then are they already doing it?
* Q12. When Daily Release would be the trend? It seems the idea is still too aggressive.
* Q13. What kind of industry, produce and team need this kind of integration speed especially?
* Q14. What is the difference between Daily Release vs Continuous Delivery?
* Q15. Feature Toggle vs Feature Branch in Daily Release
* Q16. Versioning in Daily Release
* Q17. Team structure and collaboration dynamics
* Q18. Would it weaken the communication between people and increase communication cost
* Q19.  Would it decrease the flexibility of project? 
* Q20. Long term value vs short-term value.
* Q21. A lot of redos with small changes vs one step change with bigger gap?
* Q22. How to build confidence on daily release is working?
* Q23. How to leverage language feature to boost confidence level of system stability? What kind of pattern can enable this?
* Q24. What is the checklist for daily release? Infrastructure aspect, Data aspect, Pipeline, Design, Development, Problem domain and industry

* Q25. How to deal with hardware dev like robotics?
* Q26. How to improve 1% as a team?
* Q27. How to build a environment that cultivate good daily release setup?
* Q28. How remote work with daily release
